            <h2 id="what-is">What is cellulitis?</h2>
            <p class="nhsuk-body-l">Cellulitis is an infection of the skin or tissues under the skin caused by bacteria (germs).
                People with oedema/swelling are prone to cellulitis because their lymphatic system does
                not work normally. Cellulitis may occur after damage to the skin, such as an insect bite, cut,
                scratch or athlete’s foot. It can sometimes occur without an obvious cause.
                Early treatment with antibiotics is very important. If an infection is not controlled quickly, a
                person may require hospital treatment with intravenous antibiotics (antibiotics given
                through a drip). There is a risk that cellulitis can damage the lymphatic system and make
                swelling worse. Occasionally, cellulitis infections can be life-threatening.

            <h2 id="observation">How will I know if I have cellulitis?</h2>
            <p class="nhsuk-body">Your normal swelling may be unusually hot, tender and red. The red colour may spread
                over a short number of hours. Your swelling may be larger than normal. You may feel
                unwell with ‘flu-like’ symptoms (fever, shivers, muscle aches, headache, nausea). The
                lymph nodes near the swollen area may be tender (if you have arm swelling your armpit
                may feel sore; if you have leg swelling your groin may be sore).
                Some people often have red, tender swelling which may be due to causes other than
                infection. In these cases it is more difficult to diagnose cellulitis.

            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
                <li>
                    Contact your doctor immediately. If it is ‘out of hours’, contact an out of hours medical
                    service. The doctor may find it helpful to see a photograph of what your swelling looks like
                    normally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the doctor confirms you have cellulitis, you should start treatment with antibiotics as
                    soon as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rest as much as you need to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you need a painkiller, regular paracetamol is recommended.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You may need to remove compression garments from the infected area if they are too tight and
                    uncomfortable. Some patients choose to wear an old, looser garment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you usually do lymphatic drainage massage, stop until the cellulitis is better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ideally, you should return to wearing your normal compression garments as soon as possible.
                    You may need a new garment if your limb remains more swollen after the infection gets
                    better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let your lymphoedema team know each time you’ve had an episode of cellulitis. Tell them if
                    your garment does not fit well after an infection.

                <li>Take good care of your skin.</li>

            <h2 id="else">Is there anything else?</h2>
            <p>If you have had cellulitis before, your doctor may choose to prescribe you a ‘just in case’
                course of antibiotics, so that if you think you are getting cellulitis you can start treatment
                quickly. This is particularly important if you are travelling to an area where immediate
                medical help may not be available.
            </p>

            <h3>
                You should always seek medical attention as soon as possible if you have started taking
                antibiotics for a possible cellulitis.
            </h3>
            <p>
                If you are prone to infections - if you have had several episodes of cellulitis - you may need
                long-term antibiotics (the doctor calls this ‘antibiotic prophylaxis’). You should contact the
                lymphoedema clinic who will discuss this further with you.
