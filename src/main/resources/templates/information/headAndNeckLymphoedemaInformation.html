            <h2>What is Head and Neck Lymphoedema?</h2>
            <p>Head and neck lymphoedema is a swelling that occurs in the soft tissues of the head and neck due to an impaired lymphatic system. This may result from treatments such as surgery or radiation that affect the lymph nodes, leading to fluid retention and tissue swelling. Understanding and managing this condition is crucial, especially for those who have undergone cancer treatments.</p>
