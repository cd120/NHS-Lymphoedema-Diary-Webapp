        <h1 id="what-is">What is Head and Neck Lymphoedema?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Lymphoedema is an accumulation of fluid in the tissues that can be brought on by head and neck cancers and their treatments.</p>
            <p>The head and neck region contains over 300 lymph nodes, which are part of a system that helps drains fluid from this area.  This system can be damaged by surgery or radiation.</p>
            <p>It is normal for swelling to be present for around 3 months post treatments, but this should slowly resolve.</p>
            <p>If oedema continues after 3 months, there may be damage to the lymphatic drainage system causing a build-up of fluid.  This is likely to be lymphoedema and should be discussed with your head and neck  health care team.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Head and neck lymphoedema is typically caused by damage to the lymphatic system due to surgery or radiation therapy for cancer. This damage impairs the system’s ability to drain lymphatic fluid, leading to swelling. Other causes can include infections, injuries, or congenital abnormalities that affect lymphatic drainage.</p>

        <!-- Symptoms Section -->
        <section id="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Swelling that continues 3 - 6 months after treatments</li>
                <li>Pitting oedema</li>
                <li>Difficulty swallowing, lymphoedema can be external and internal</li>
                <li>Reduced movement/tightness and heaviness</li>
                <li>Symptoms that are worse in the morning and improve over the day when you are up and active</li>
                <li>Infections called cellulitis</li>

                    <p>Accurate measurements are essential for tracking the progression and management of lymphoedema. Use a flexible tape measure to gauge the circumference of the affected areas consistently over time. Document these measurements regularly and share them with your healthcare provider.</p>

                    <h2>Exercising</h2>
                    <p>There is much evidence to show that simple activity can significantly help prevent cancer recurrence and also other long-term illnesses, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. Cancer and its treatments can cause physical changes and dealing with these is often stressful. Being more physically active can help you cope with and recover from some of these changes.</p>
                    <p>Being active during and after treatment can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduce fatigue.</li>
                        <li>Reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
                        <li>Help look after your bones.</li>
                        <li>Help look after your heart.</li>
                        <li>Help reduce your risk of getting a blood clot.</li>
                        <li>Help keep your weight healthy.</li>
                        <li>Relieve pain.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why Should I Exercise?</h3>
                    <p>Your neck and shoulders can become stiff and tight:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Post surgery</li>
                        <li>During your radiation treatment</li>
                        <li>Immediately after your radiation treatment has ended</li>
                        <li>A long time after your radiation has ended</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The exercises in this leaflet will help:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve lymphatic drainage and help reduce swelling.</li>
                        <li>Prevent you from feeling stiffness.</li>
                        <li>Improve any stiffness you may feel in your neck and shoulders from your radiation treatment.</li>
                        <li>Help the wound to heal and become flexible.</li>
                        <li>Reduce the risk of lymphedema swelling caused by a build-up of lymph fluid.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Why Are Stretching Exercises Important?</h3>
                    <p>Radiation treatment can make your muscles and soft tissues stiff and tight. This condition is called radiation-induced fibrosis. It can occur at any point after you have had radiotherapy, sometimes a few years down the line. This can be painful, change your posture, or affect your joints.</p>

                    <h3>Neck Exercises</h3>
                    <p><strong>Following your surgery:</strong> These exercises should be performed three times a day. Try to repeat each exercise up to three times but stop if you become dizzy.</p>
                    <p><strong>During radiation treatment:</strong> Do the exercises every day during radiation treatment.</p>
                    <p><strong>How long do I do these exercises for?</strong> You should do these exercises three times a day until 6 weeks after your radiation treatment is done. We advise continuing with these exercises once a day long-term.</p>
                    <h4>Safety Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may feel a pull in your muscle but you should not feel any pain. If you feel pain, try not to stretch so far.</li>
                        <li>If the exercises are uncomfortable, you can take your pain medication 30 minutes before exercising.</li>
                        <li>If you have had surgery, some of the exercises may not be possible. You may be told by your surgeon to avoid certain movements after your surgery.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Warm-up Exercises – 10 repetitions of each</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h3>Throat</h3>
                    <p>You will need a small rubber ball or sponge. Sitting upright, place the ball under your chin and hold it in place. Push your chin against the ball for as long as you can, aiming for a maximum of a minute. Repeat twice. In the same position, push your chin against the ball and release quickly. Complete 30 repetitions of this, building up to doing 3 sets of 30 repetitions.</p>

                    <h3>Airway</h3>
                    <p>Practice swallowing with effort. Hold your breath, push your tongue into the roof of your mouth if you can, squeeze your throat muscles tight and swallow. Repeat this up to 10 times. To make this even more effective, push down on a table or chair arms whilst holding your breath, then swallow.</p>

                    <p>Treatment for head and neck lymphoedema typically involves a combination of physical therapy, compression garments, and exercises. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a specialized massage technique that may also be recommended. Consistent management is key to improving outcomes and maintaining quality of life.</p>

                    <h3>Skin and Oral Care</h3>
                    <p>Proper skin care is crucial to prevent infections such as cellulitis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moisturize the neck, chin, and cheeks daily with a non-perfumed moisturizer. Apply with gentle downward strokes towards your neck and collar bone.</li>
                        <li>Keep your skin hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.</li>
                        <li>Use non-perfumed products to cleanse the skin. Pat the skin dry; do not rub or cause friction.</li>
                        <li>Use a high-factor sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when exposed to sunlight.</li>
                        <li>Avoid shaving with a razor; use an electric shaver to reduce the risk of cuts. Avoid facial waxing, electrolysis, or facial bleach.</li>
                        <li>Treat any skin breaks promptly with antiseptic cream.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Manual and Simple Lymphatic Drainage</h3>
                    <p>Manual and simple lymphatic drainage is a gentle massage where the skin is stretched along the lymphatic pathway. Regular simple Lymphatic Drainage can help move extra fluid from swollen areas damaged by cancer treatments to areas where the lymphatic system is working well. To be effective Simple Lymphatic drainage needs to be carried out daily and may be a long-term requirement to support the Lymphatic system.</p>
                    <p>The following link is a Lymphoedema Support network link for Simple lymphatic drainage of the head and neck:</p>

                    <h3>Kinesio Tape</h3>
                    <p>Kinesio tape can be used to help lymphatic drainage by lifting the skin in the affected area or as a support/correction strip. </p>

                    <p>Kinesio can also be used for scar/ fibrosed tissue</p>

                    <h3>Positioning</h3>
                    <p>Lymphoedema in the head and neck often worsens overnight. Raise the head of your bed or use pillows to elevate your head. A wedge pillow may also help with positioning.</p>

                    <h3>Rollers</h3>
                    <p>Jade rollers and wallpaper rollers are a useful tool for lymphatic drainage of the head and neck and can be purchased by patients for usually under £10s.  They are used to help move the fluid through the skin from areas that are struggling to drain to areas that are draining and towards working lymphatics</p>

                    <h3>Scar Care Following Surgery</h3>
                    <p>Scars mainly ‘form’ over the first 2-3 months. It is important over this time to encourage them to be flexible enough to allow you to use your upper body as you did before surgery. One way of doing this is to do the regular exercises shown to you further on in this leaflet; another is to gently massage the scar.</p>
                    <h4>How Should I Massage My Scar?</h4>
                    <p>Once your wound has fully healed, has no scabs, and no sign of infection (normally 3-4 weeks), you can start to massage it. Use a moisturiser, such as E45, available from chemists or on prescription. Gently and lightly massage over your scar with small circular movements for about 5 minutes, once or twice a day, ideally after a bath or shower. This will also help to soften/flatten the scar and make it less sensitive.</p>
                    <h4>How Long Should I Massage the Scar?</h4>
                    <p>Continue for a minimum of 3 months after your surgery, ideally for 2 years as scars can change their shape and continue to tighten for several years. The longer you do it, the better the results will be in terms of scar flexibility and how it looks cosmetically. As your scar will be sensitive to sunlight for several years, a high-factor sun cream is recommended.</p>
                    <h3>Skin Care</h3>
                    <p>Following radiotherapy, moisturise the neck, chin, and cheeks daily using a non-perfumed moisturiser to keep your skin soft and supple using gentle downward strokes towards your neck and collar bone. It is important to keep the skin well hydrated; this can be helped by drinking plenty of fluids. Keep the skin cleansed with gentle products that do not dry out the skin. Pat the skin dry, do not rub or cause friction to the skin as the skin may be fragile following your treatments.</p>
                    <p>Following your surgery, you may experience changes in sensation around your scar (e.g. numbness, tingling, or extra sensitivity to touch). These sensations are common and often subside a few months after your surgery. Gentle massage or tapping around the area may ease the discomfort and help restore normal sensation. However, you may be left with some lasting numbness.</p>
