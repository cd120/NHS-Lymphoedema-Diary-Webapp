        <h1 id="what-is">What is Head and Neck Lymphoedema?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Head and neck lymphoedema is a swelling that occurs in the soft tissues of the head and neck due to an impaired lymphatic system. This may result from treatments such as surgery or radiation that affect the lymph nodes, leading to fluid retention and tissue swelling. Understanding and managing this condition is crucial, especially for those who have undergone cancer treatments.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Head and neck lymphoedema often occurs as a secondary condition following treatment for head and neck cancers. These treatments can damage the lymphatic system, impairing its ability to drain fluid effectively. Other causes may include infections, injuries, or congenital abnormalities that affect the lymphatic system.</p>

                <li>A feeling of fullness or tightness in the affected areas</li>
                <li>Changes in the texture of the skin</li>
                <li>Reduced flexibility in the neck or jaw</li>
                <li>Difficulty with daily activities due to discomfort or swelling</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="risk-factors">
            <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
            <p>Several factors can increase the risk of developing head and neck lymphoedema, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extensive surgery or radiation therapy in the head and neck region</li>
                <li>Obesity or being overweight</li>
                <li>Infection or injury to the lymphatic system</li>
                <li>Pre-existing venous conditions</li>
                <li>Lack of physical activity or movement post-surgery</li>

        <!-- Diagnosis Section -->
        <section id="diagnosis">
            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnosis of head and neck lymphoedema is typically made through a combination of physical examination and imaging techniques such as lymphoscintigraphy, which helps visualize the lymphatic system. Your healthcare provider may also use measurements and patient history to assess the extent and impact of the swelling.</p>

                    <p>Accurate measurement of swelling is essential for tracking the progression and management of lymphoedema. Measurements should be taken at consistent points over time, using a flexible tape measure to gauge the circumference of the affected areas. It is important to measure the same points each time, such as specific landmarks on the neck or jaw, to monitor any changes effectively.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to document these measurements regularly and share them with your healthcare provider to help adjust your treatment plan as needed.</p>

                    <p>Compression garments for the head and neck are designed to apply consistent pressure to the swollen area, helping to manage swelling and prevent further accumulation of fluid. These garments should be worn as directed by your healthcare provider, typically for most of the day, but they should be removed at night unless otherwise instructed.</p>
                    <p>It is important to regularly check the fit of these garments, as changes in swelling can affect how well they work. Regular washing and proper care will also prolong their effectiveness.</p>
